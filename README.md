# WinLearningAid

First things first: Attention, do not use. This is an abandoned legacy project that needs to be cleaned up. There are no binaries. You need to fork/clone 
this project and compile it yourself, for example using SharpDevelop or MonoDevelop and C#/.NET 3.5.

The purpose of this program is to help you learn information through constant and casual repetition.

# Use case:

1. Create a mind map using [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). The leaves of the mind map will be "the answers", while their parent nodes will be "the questions". All other nodes will be ignored.
1. Compile WLA, start the program. It will sit as icon in the system tray. Open the config dialog by right-clicking and selecting "config".
1. Load the mind map into the program, close the config window.
1. After some time, WLA will create popup tooltips with questions and some seconds after that, show the answer. 
1. Optionally, questions will be read aloud, so will be the answers. Make sure you have a decent SAPI5 voice of the desired language installed. Those are hard to get though or will cost money.

This way, you can learn huge amounts of information in a short period of time. It was an invaluable tool during my studies.
